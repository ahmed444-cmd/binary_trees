0x1D C - Binary Trees ✏️

C is a versatile and powerful programming language, often used for developing operating systems, databases, and compilers, among other applications. This project delves into the concepts of binary trees, developed in collaboration with my peer, Jorge Zafra. Kudos to him for his contributions to numerous SWE projects!

By the end of this project, we were able to comprehend the following concepts:

Understanding what a binary tree is
Distinguishing between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
Identifying potential time complexity gains compared to linked lists
Defining the depth, height, and size of a binary tree
Exploring different traversal methods for binary trees
Recognizing complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees
